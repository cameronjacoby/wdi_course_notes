What is the DOM?

- Document Object Model
- Formatting / standardization
- HTML 'document'

- The DOM is the structure of elements on the page (HTML has tags for CSS to map to)
- The DOM takes the HTML elements (document) on the page and produces the output (the objects)
- ** The DOM is your HTML once it has been read and processed by the browser ** --> it is a representation of your HTML
---> reads a 'string' of text, takes the HTML tags, and turns them into objects
