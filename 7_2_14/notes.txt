Chrome Developer Tools:

COMMAND + OPTION + j --> opens chrome console
	--> also where to find 'inspect elememt'
	--> console is a JavaScript console --> see JavaScript executed live

----------


JavaScript:

console.log() --> prints out to the console
	--> great tool for debugging your code: print out what your code should return so you can check it

integers refer to whole numbers, i.e. 4 + 20
floats are numbers with decimals --> take up much more space than integers
	--> always use integers if you know you will be stricly dealing with whole numbers
	--> floats and integers behave the same way except for division
			--> e.g. 3/2 returns 1; 3.0/2.0 returns 1.5

data types: strings, integers, floats, booleans

booleans --> can be true or false; produced by expressions that return true or false

variables --> containers used to store values
	
	var name = "Cameron";
	> name
	"Cameron"

	var age = 24;
	var isDog = false;
	> age
	24
	> isDog
	false

	--> variables allow us to send/store info in database

	var name = prompt("What's your name?");
	> name
	"Cameron"

arrays --> variables that hold unlimited info; info will hold its order inside the array unless it is changed

array.pop() --> removes the last element from the array
array.push() --> pushes a new elements to the end of the array
