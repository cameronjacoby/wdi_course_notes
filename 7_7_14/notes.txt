Web Basics:

Difference between 'www' and Internet:
  - 'www' --> browser technology that uses HTML, .ISON, HTTP
  - Internet --> network of connected computers

  - SMTP --> simple mail transfer protocall (communication dial / dialogue between servers)
  - HTTP --> hyper text transfer protocall (communication dial / dialogue between servers) / how your browser and a web server communicate
  * HTTP is the visible web that we work with in the browser *
    - TCP (transmission control protocall) is underlying this --> TCP is how any device communicates with a web server

https://www.google.com/search?q=donuts
- https --> protocol ('s' stands for secure)
- www.google.com --> domain name
  - domain name server (DNS) finds the IP address associated with the domain name
- /search --> URI (uniform resource indicator), or 'path'; means we want to go to the 'search' feature on google's website
- q=donuts --> query params; must appear after the '?' in the URL

Types of web requests:
(use cURL on the command line to make requests)
  - Get --> gets info from a webpage (returns a webpage)
    - Get example.com
  - Post --> sends info to a URL
  - Delete --> deletes a webpage
  - Update (also called Put) --> gives us a way to update info on a webpage
    - Changing something on your Facebook profile sends an update request to Facebook

  * Get and Post are all the browser understands
